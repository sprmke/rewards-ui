# TESTS
This directory contains all test realated files (unit, automation, e2e, etc).

**Important Notes**
This application is using Jest and Vue test utils for unit testing.
Global jest config must be set under config directory.
Add only 'global mock data' to shared-mock-data.js.
Module or component mock data must be stored on their respected directory.
You can add new test utils on test-utils.js but make sure to add a title comment on your new test util.
